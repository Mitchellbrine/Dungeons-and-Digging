Dungeons-and-Digging
====================
A mod made by the brand new Wild Kingdoms Mod Team.
It adds ores, gems, tools, armor, new monsters, and even ruins!

News: Due to a bug, the recipes were disabled. To enable them, remove the comments with .recipes in "Main.java". That WILL cause a but, though.

Currently in the mod:
Crystal, Ruby, and Sapphire Ores that randomly spawn
Crystal, Ruby, and Sapphire Gems, droped by the blocks.
Crystal, Ruby, and Sapphire Solid Blocks, unobtaineble on survival mode due to the bug above.

TODO:
Tools (about to be done)
Armor (about to be done)
Mobs (Planned)
Ruins (Planned)
